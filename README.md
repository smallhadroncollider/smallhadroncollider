![Small Hadron Collider](https://github.com/smallhadroncollider/smallhadroncollider/blob/main/title.jpg?raw=true)

I'm a software developer and consultant based in Bristol.

Until 2018 I mostly wrote Laravel and React apps, but more recently I've concentrated on Haskell.

Since 2019 I'm also Curriculum Director and an instructor at [DevelopMe_](https://developme.tech).
